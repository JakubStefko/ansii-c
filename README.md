# Hello

This is my repository with codes made while  
learning about ANSI C and reading book  
'ANSI C' made by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie.

I want to know a little bit more about pure C language.  
If you program in it and want to give me some advices  
or just talk about fun stuff in c write to me :)  

# Structure
chapters -> folders  
sub-chapters -> sub-folders
