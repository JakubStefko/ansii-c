I am getting strange error in this chapter.
I get the point of algorithm but after running
them i get:
0 > when i pass ending char in first place
2 > when i pass it on second
4 > when i pass it on third

Both algorithms work the same.
Compiled with cc on Ubuntu.

If you have any idea why this works that way
let me know pls.
