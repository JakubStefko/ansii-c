Question: How to test 1.c which is dumber version of wc in Unix?
My answer:
  Big text files to defeat int counters for sure :)
  I would also check some non-standard alphabets.
Disclaimer:
  Yes, I know those "file" related programs now are dumb,
  because I havn't reached streams yet and i cannot "pipe"
  text file into program as a normal human being.
  Still doing it for fun and learning purposes :)
